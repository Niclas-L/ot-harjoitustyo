# Functional Specifications

## The Application's Purpose
The goal is to create a functioning clone of the popular game [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) using Python's Pygame library. In this puzzle game the user will get to firstly try to complete the goal of the game (assemble a 2048-tile) and then strive for a new highscore.

## Base Functionality
- The user is presented with a 4x4 grid in which the game itself is played
- The user can see their current and highest scores
- The user can open a "how-to-play"-screen to see an explanation of how the game is played
- The user can access a screen displaying the ten highest previous scores
- Tiles range from 2 to 2048 in value

## User Interface Draft
![The game screen functions as the main screen. From here the user can access two other screens, the highscore display and the "how-to-play"-screen.](https://github.com/Niclas-L/ot-harjoitustyo/blob/master/documentation/images/2048functioncalspec.png)
The game screen functions as the main screen. From here the user can access two other screens, the highscore display and the "how-to-play"-screen.

## Further Development Ideas
- Add support for tiles larger than 2048
- Saving ongoing game between sessions
- Add animations to moving tiles
