# Architecture Description

## Structure
All of the game's files are located in the src directory. Only renderer.py is responsible for the ui while all other files handle game logic.


## UI
Currently the UI only consists of one single screen, the main game screen. The UI is implemented using the pygame module in the renderer.py file.

## Application logic
